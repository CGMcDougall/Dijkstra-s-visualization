# Dijkstra-s-visualization
!!WIP!!


Author: Connor McDougall

Goal: To make a unity Application that simulates Dijsktra's algorithm 

Operation:

     To link Nodes togeter, add a node to the "linked" list in the script 
     To add more Nodes, navigate to "assets" folder and add nodes to scene
          IMPORTANT: Nodes in scene must have a corresponding int value
          ex: the first node would be named Node (0), second would be Node (1), etc.
     Drag Nodes around in the scene to increase or decrease the length of paths
     Press play to run
     
     
      

How it Functions:
    
    Uses Node Objects as substitute for points on a graph
        Displays Node Index in black next to Node
    Uses Distance between objects for path weight values
        Displays Path weight in red next to Path
